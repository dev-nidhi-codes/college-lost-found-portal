#College Lost and Found Portal


The College Lost & Found Portal is a web-based application designed to help students and faculty easily report, search, and recover lost items on campus. Users can post details of items they have lost or found, browse through categorized listings, and securely connect with item owners.

This project aims to reduce the hassle of misplaced belongings by creating a centralized digital space for lost and found management within the college community.
